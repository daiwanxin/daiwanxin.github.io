                            <p>My hobbies are watching and appreciating the night scenery and lighting performances of each city, and <br> Every city's night scenery has its own beauty. I personally enjoy the night scenery and like to collect these photos. </p>
                            <p>Three years ago, because of her departure, I could only quietly look at the night scene of the city and slowly think about life when I was bored. Since then, I have particularly enjoyed this feeling. I can enjoy the cool and watch the night scene at night. </p>
                            <p>In the past three years, I have visited many cities with very prosperous night scenery, such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou, Nanning and many other modern cities. Each city gives me a different feeling and is very prosperous. Both urban planning and night scenery are excellent </p>
                            <p>The style of each city is different. There are led light shows and more transparent Guangzhou. The most representative cities of LED light shows are Shanghai and Shenzhen, which show technology, R & D and the future.</p>
                            <p>I prefer distant vision or UAV video. When I have enough time, I will also make some video clips that I have taken and publish them online to share with you. Every spring, the night scene is the most beautiful and spectacular, with natural flowers and flower fragrance and moving lights. In the national day, Guangzhou tower, Lujiazui and other CBD will see very spectacular light shows..</p>
